## Note on the Design

This example demonstrates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** using a simple journal application. At first glance, it might seem that the implementation in `prg01-srp_violation.py`—which combines responsibilities—would reduce code complexity. After all, we don't want to create extra files and classes just to keep a personal journal!

However, adhering to SRP, even in simple cases, provides several important benefits:

- **Logical Structure:** Separating responsibilities leads to a more intuitive and maintainable codebase.
- **Extensibility:** By following SRP, it's easier to extend the program in the future. For example, adding new journal-keeping features or supporting different storage mechanisms becomes straightforward.
- **Code Reuse:** SRP-compliant design prevents code duplication. For instance, if you need to manage the persistence of other files, you can reuse the `PersistenceManager` class instead of duplicating file-saving logic in multiple places.
- **Ease of Refactoring:** Avoiding SRP initially may lead to more complex refactoring later, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

For example, if you want to save your journal to a different location, you can simply add a method to the `PersistenceManager` class. Similarly, you can create a new journal instance for a notebook, reusing the same saving and retrieving functionalities.

By designing with SRP in mind from the beginning, you prepare your application for future requirements and avoid unnecessary duplication and refactoring.
